Cheat engine is a software that allows you to modify the memory of any running process on your computer. You can use it to change values such as health, ammo, money, or anything else that is stored in the game's memory.

However, using cheat engine is not as simple as clicking a button. You need to know how to find the right addresses and values in the game's memory, and how to avoid detection by the game's anti-cheat system.
